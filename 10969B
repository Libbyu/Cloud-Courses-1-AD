Identity: Set of data that uniquely describes a person or an object
          contains information about the subject's relationships to other entities
          -stored in directory database
          -in AD DS, 'identity' are called 'security principals'
          -represented uniquely by the 'SID(Security Identifier, 보안계정)'
          -used to access the resource
          * for security = Authentication + Authorization (보안 = 인증 + 권한)
Authentication: the process that verifies a user's identity through 'Credentials'
          - Credential: ID + Password
          - Authentication Type: Local(interactive) to 'Local computer'; stand-alone authentication(authorized by local SAM)
                                 Remote(network) to 'Another computer'; joining to a domain
Authorization: the process that determines whether to grant or deny a user a requested level of access to a resource
          - Requirement: Resource/ Access request/ Security token
          - 접근 '요청'을 하고, 접근되면 '보안 토큰'으로 허용된 권한을 사용 
AIP: 
          - Store information: users/ groups/ computers/ other identities
          - Authenticate an identity: using Kerberos, identity in AD
          - Control access
          - Provide an audit trail
AD DS Replication(multimaster replication model): between standard domain controllers/ RODCs
          - Accuracy (integrity)/ Consistency(Convergence)/ Performance(keeping replication traffic at a resonable level)
AD DS Partitions:
          - Components: Application - Domain - Schema - Configuration
SYSVOL:
          - Contains: Logon scripts/ Group policy templates/ Group policy objects
          - Sysvol replication: FRS/DFS to 숨겨진 시스템 파일을 복제하는 작업
Policy: defines a specific configuration change
          - Policy Setting Status: Not Configured/ Enabled/ Disabled
GPO order: Local GPOs > Site-Level GPOs > Domain-Level GPOs > OU GPOs(including any nested OUs)
PKI(인증서비스 방법): the combination of software, encryption technologies, processes, and services that enables an organization to secure its communications and buisiness transactions
          - PKI and Cert. provide: Confidentiality/ Integrity/ Authenticity/ Non-repudiation/ Availabilityㅁ
AD FS:
          - Certificates used by AD FS: Service communication certificates,
                    Token-signing certificates, Token-decrypting certificates
          - Claims provider trusts: Identify the claims provider, configure the claim rules for the claims provider
          - Single-organization scenario
